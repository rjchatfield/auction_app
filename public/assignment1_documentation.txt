# 2503ICT ASSIGNMENT 1 DOCUMENTATION #
#------------------------------------#
# NAME: ROBERT CHATFIELD             #
# STUDENT NUMBER: S2187099           #
# DATE: TUESDAY, 28TH JANUARY        #
#------------------------------------#


# AUCTION APP #


## SETUP

   $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:rjchatfield/auction-app.git
   $ cd auction_app
   $ rails s
   $ open http://localhost:3000/        # in new Terminal tab


## SAMPLE DATA GENERATION

   $ rake db:reset; rake db:populate

   This function will
     * create the database (if there is none present)
     * purge any data (if there already was a db present)
     * populate it using a script in /auction_app/lib/tasks/sample_data.rake


## USAGE

   Navigation Bar bar items are as follows.

   [Buy]:   Will take you to the items#index with the search feature
   [Sell]:  Will take you to the items#new
   [Admin]: Will take you to the categories#index.
            This is not protected with any authentication.


## FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTEND

   All features were implemented as per the assignment specification provided
   Sunday, 26th January.


## ADDITIONAL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

 * Categories filter can be triggered by clicking on the category in items#index
 or items#show.
 * Pagination of items#index
 * Fancy CSS hover of debug information while in Rails Development.
   Try hovering over the bottom of any HTML page to see the debug information.
   This 'reveal on hover' technique helped with UI development (without being
   too distracting).


## USABILITY TESTING

   Many hours of developer testing was completed during production of this
   application. This included continual testing across browsers such as Apple
   Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

   Additionally, my father also participated in an informal testing and feedback
   session. I briefed my father of the core features of the application, what it
   was aiming to do and what was outside of the scope of this assignment.

   FEEDBACK: It was impressive overall, however he found it confusing to get
             back to the main page.
   CHANGES:  While there was always a link on every page (provided in the
             header), it was apparent that it wasn't the obvious way "home". To
             rectify this, I improved the colour scheme and styling in the main
             CSS file.
